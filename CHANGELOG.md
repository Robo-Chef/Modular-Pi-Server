### Configuration

- **DNS Server**: 192.168.1.XXX
- **Web Interfaces**:
  - Pi-hole Admin: `http://192.168.1.XXX/admin`
  - Grafana: `http://192.168.1.XXX:3000`
  - Uptime Kuma: `http://192.168.1.XXX:3001`
- **SSH Port**: 2222 (custom)
- **Docker Networks**: 172.20.0.0/24 (pihole), 172.21.0.0/24 (monitoring)

### Performance

- **DNS Response Time**: <50ms (cached), <200ms (uncached)
- **Memory Usage**: ~400MB (base), ~700MB (with monitoring)
- **Storage I/O**: 98% read operations (optimized)
- **Container Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints
